# Advent of Code 2025

https://adventofcode.com/2025

This year, I'll solve the puzzles using PHP. I'll approach the puzzles from scratch, without looking at structures 
from previous years.

I'll be using the [Pest](https://pestphp.com/) testing framework to become familiar with it.

## Setup

```bash
composer install
```

## Run

Solve the puzzle of a specific day and part. 
The optional parameter "example" can be used to run the solver with the example input.

```bash
./solve 01 A --example
```

## Tests

To run the tests:

```bash
vendor/bin/pest
```
